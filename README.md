# 🤖 JARVIS - Python-Based AI Desktop Assistant

JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a Python-powered desktop assistant inspired by Iron Man's iconic AI system. It integrates facial recognition, voice feedback, and an interactive graphical user interface to create a basic but functional personal assistant.

This project demonstrates how automation can be used to create intelligent assistants with user-friendly features and modular components.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Face Recognition**: Authenticate users via webcam using OpenCV.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: Built with Tkinter to provide a clean and responsive user experience.
- **Voice Feedback**: Responds using pre-recorded or generated audio files.
- **Modular Design**: Components are separated for scalability and easy maintenance.
- **Basic Command Execution**: Potential to add commands such as opening apps, fetching weather, or telling the time (expandable).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Facial Recognition**:
   - Uses OpenCV and face-recognition library to detect faces via the webcam.

2. **Voice Feedback**:
   - Plays predefined audio messages for user interaction.
   - uses text-to-speech engine, pyttsx3.

3. **Graphical Interface**:
   - The GUI is built with Tkinter to guide the user through interactions.
   - Provides visual feedback .
