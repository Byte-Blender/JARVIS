# 🤖 JARVIS - Python-Based AI Desktop Assistant

JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a Python-powered desktop assistant inspired by Iron Man's iconic AI system. It integrates facial recognition, voice feedback, and an interactive graphical user interface to create a basic but functional personal assistant.

This project demonstrates how machine learning and automation can be used to create intelligent assistants with user-friendly features and modular components.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Face Recognition**: Authenticate users via webcam using OpenCV.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: Built with Tkinter to provide a clean and responsive user experience.
- **Voice Feedback**: Responds using pre-recorded or generated audio files.
- **Modular Design**: Components are separated for scalability and easy maintenance.
- **Basic Command Execution**: Potential to add commands such as opening apps, fetching weather, or telling the time (expandable).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Facial Recognition**:
   - Uses OpenCV and Haar Cascades to detect faces via the webcam.
   - Recognizes registered faces and grants access to the assistant.

2. **Voice Feedback**:
   - Plays predefined audio messages for user interaction.
   - Can be extended to use text-to-speech engines like pyttsx3 or gTTS.

3. **Graphical Interface**:
   - The GUI is built with Tkinter to guide the user through interactions.
   - Provides visual feedback and clickable elements (e.g., buttons for actions).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash

cd JARVIS
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python GUI.py
📚 Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:

opencv-python

numpy

tkinter (standard with Python)

playsound or pygame (for audio playback)

Ensure these are listed in your requirements.txt.

📌 Future Enhancements
✅ Live speech-to-text input

✅ Integration with system commands (e.g., open browser, run apps)

✅ Context-aware dialogue system using NLP

✅ Integration with ChatGPT API for smarter responses

✅ Custom wake word detection

✅ User registration and training from GUI
